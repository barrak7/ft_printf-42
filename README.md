# ft_printf-42
My mini-printf, a humble implimentation of the printf function and my second project in the 42 Cursus

Working on this project, I was exposed to a new concept which is the variadic functions.

To understand the variadic functions and how they work, I had to deepen my understanding of computer memory and the CPU.

This function supports the following conversions "%s, %c, %d, %u, %i, %x, %X, %p, %%".
